Project 1: Display a Seven Segment LED using GPIO Pins

    Description: GPIO Port C pins 0 to 6 were used for connecting the seven segment led

                 Common Cathode:
                       data: 0 = 0x3F
                       data: 1 = 0x06
                       data: 2 = 0x5B
                       data: 3 = 0x4F
                       data: 4 = 0x66
                       data: 5 = 0x6D
                       data: 6 = 0x7D
                       data: 7 = 0x07
                       data: 8 = 0x7F
